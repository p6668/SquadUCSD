This web app allows students to form study groups for the classes they are enrolled in. Groups are formed based on schedule compatibility and individual personalities and preferences. Groups can set a maximum size to allow however many people in. This can be changed any time.

Zi's todo list:
1. add classes duplicate checks
2. add password checking for special characters
3. check flags for editprofile(fail, success and saved)
4. class length to be 40?
5. maybe don't display the button's in profile page if user not logged in
